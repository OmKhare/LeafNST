An Improved Data Augmentation Method for Classification of Plant Disease using Object-Based Neural Style Transfer

## Motivation
- Plant diseases significantly threaten global agriculture, impacting crop yield and food security and nearly 30% of the crop yield is lost due to plant diseases.
- Efficient identification and classification of plant diseases through computer vision techniques have become imperative for timely intervention.
- However, popular plant disease datasets often suffer from data imbalance, with certain classes underrepresented, hindering the performance of machine learning models.

## Part 1- Developing Object-based Neural Style Transfer
- Introduced a pioneering methodology for object-based image-to-image style transfer.
- This innovative approach employs a single deep convolutional neural network that ingeniously integrates the capabilities of You Only Look Once version 8 (YOLOv8) for object segmentation with a CNN for style transfer.

## Part 2- Using the above approach for Data Augmentation and comparing it with other SOTA Data Augmentation methods
- Building upon our previous research, we have addressed the aforementioned data imbalance issue in plant disease datasets.
- By adopting an advanced approach of CNN-based Style Transfer for data augmentation, we could generate synthetic images that more accurately represent underrepresented classes within these datasets.
- Finally, we have compared our approach of using Neural Style Transfer with other state-of-the-art Data Augmentation methods (including GANs, traditional techniques etc.) on different datasets.
